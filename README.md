# Music-Player
A very basic music player application

#Motivation
The main idea of taking up this project was to deal with pymedia and wx python at the same time and develop a tool out of it.

#Requirements
1.wx python
2.python 2.7+
3.pymedia

#Installation Notes
After you are done with proper installation of the requirements you just need to clone this repository and compile "player.py".
NOTE: The volume control button is under construction and may not be functional
Also, for best results(layouting and all) please use this in Windows.
